The idea behind this browser is to try to implement all known privacy features allowed by Android while keeping the code as easier as possible to read and understand.

A group of javascript callback functions is also in place to allow anyone to design a new landing page and funnel all url and search operation through your own server thus keeping as much control as possible under your hands.

Any contribution of course and usual more than welcome! :)
